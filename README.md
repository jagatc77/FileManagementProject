# FileManagementProject
File Management System is a simple, menu‑driven C++ application demonstrating core file‑handling operations such as writing, reading, and appending data to text files. The project uses standard C++ libraries (fstream, ifstream, ofstream) and is designed to showcase basic file I/O concepts for learning, internships, and academic submissions.
